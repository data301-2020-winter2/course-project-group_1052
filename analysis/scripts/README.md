# Directory where custom scripts are made

## What you'll find in this directory

Here you will find **.py files**, whose contents are custom functions that can be imported into other jupyter notebooks.

Contributers to this directory are:

- Thomas
- Tia

To import/use these functions:

```python
    from scripts.analysis import project_functions as pf
```

This is assuming your directory is in course-project-group_1052
