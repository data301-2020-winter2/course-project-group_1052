## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{The censorship of mainstream pop songs for the demographic of children is a point of interest in regards to how children consume media. How media is changed to be under a "family friendly brand", with the brand following a certain set of ideals that are both centered around children's safety and parent's ideals. It is common for companies to change their approach to marketing and building media to suit these ideals. Consequently, movies, songs and advertisements either are toned down or altered. Kidz Bop is an example of a well known company putting these familiar ideals into practice, and are primarily known for their alterations of popular songs to suit their younger audience. Kidz Bop continues to expand this venture by making covers, producing music videos primarily featurin children and making merchandise targeted towards said demographic.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This data set is a collection of data based on the censorship of the popular commercial musical group "KIDZ BOP". KIDS BOP is a well known and successful venture, which focuses on young artists covering popular chart topping songs in a family friendly and youth centered approach. In accordance with their family centric buisness model, contasting with the common explicitives in pop music, it is a natural consequence that songs must be altered for a KIDZ BOP cover. This dataset describes the artists, word of interest, number of times each word appears per song, category of explicitive, and whether the word was censored or not.

This data set was referenced from The Pudding article "Just how does Kidz Bop censor songs?" published in April, 2020.}
